556,I thought ROTJ clearly best three Star Wars movie I find surprising ROTJ considered weakest installment Trilogy many voted To seemed like ROTJ best profound plot suspense surprise emotional especially ending definitely most episodic movie I personally like Empire Strikes Back lot also I think slightly le good ROTJ since slower moving episodic I feel much suspense emotion I third movie It also seems like after reading surprising review reason people cited ROTJ an inferior film two plain ludicrous insignificant reason compared sheer excellence film whole I heard many strange reason Because Yoda died b Because Bobba Fett died c Because small Ewoks defeated band stormtroopers Because Darth Vader revealed I would like debunk reason I believe miss point completely First WHO CARES Bobba Fett died If George Lucas wanted die wanted die Don get wrong I fan Bobba Fett he made few cameo appearance Lucas intention make central character film Star Wars fan made His name even mentioned anywhere movie You go credit find Bobba Fett name Judging ROTJ minor character died bit much I think Secondly many fan like Yoda dying Sure momentous period movie I happy see die either make movie realistic All good guy stay alive realistic movie know Otherwise ALL good guy lived ALL bad guy died movie would been tantamount a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon Another aspect point people liking Yoda death Well nobody complained Darth Vader struck Obi Wan Kenobi A New Hope Many consider A New Hope best Trilogy Why Obi Wan death okay Yoda not hmmmmmmmmmmmm Another reason I not believe even stated people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers impossible That utterly ridiculous I not believe this one First Ewoks native planet Endor cognizant home terrain since live If watch movie carefully many tactic Ewoks used defeating stormtroopers through excellent use their home field advantage Since lived forest life I hope would learned use advantage They swinging vine rope log set trip walker other trap The stormtroopers highly disadvantaged they outnumbered not aware the advantage the forest The thing they their blaster To add not like the Ewoks battling the stormtroopers they heavily assisted the band rebel conquest I thought the stormtroopers defeated a combination the Star Wars hero the band rebel well the huge clan Ewoks great familiarity their home terrain would been a great upset Lastly this scene still unbelievable How Empire Strikes Back A New Hope there SEVERAL scene a group consisting just Han Solo Chewbacca the Princess shot like ten stormtroopers their blaster missed the hero full view And not the hero course always hit the Stormtroopers their blaster The trooper must VERY VERY bad aim At least Empire Strikes Back the Battle Endor much believable since you had two army pitted other not hero a legion stormtroopers Don believe Check out the battle Cloud City our hero escaping Lando base Or our hero rescuing Princess Leia shot somehow they missed Han Solo Luke trying exit the Death Star The last reason I care discus others just plain ridiculous spend time people did not like Darth Vader being revealed Well many way a major part the plot the movie Luke trying to find whether not Darth Vader father Annakin Skywalker It would been disappointing the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father face it made it complete By Annakin revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent being possessed the dark side his helmet to the good person he Annakin Skywalker by removing the helmet The point Annakin died converted to the light side the meaning the helmet removal scene In fact I would done scene I Luke father Isn t what you would done if you wanted to see your son your eye you died not a mechanized helmet On another note I think a subconscious conscious expectation among most people the sequel MUST be worse even if it better preceding movie another reason ROTJ not get many accolade it deserves I never go a film deception in mind I always try to go a film the attitude Well it might be better worse the original But I can not know sure Let s see That way I go an open mind do not dupe into thinking a clearly superior film not good a it really I not sure criticizes movie I have asked many college student adult about which is their favorite Star Wars movie they tell me except one person that said that A New Hope their favorite that it is ROTJ I believe that the result these poll are appalling quite misleading Bottom line the Return the Jedi wa the best the Trilogy This movie wa the only one the three that kept me riveted all throughout minute There wa not a moment boredom each scene wa either suspenseful exciting surprising all of the For example the emotional light saber battle Luke and his father in ROTJ wa better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back day Finally I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind if fan start looking nitpicky insignificant detail see it a just another sequel to trash the movie a This movie stink because Luke is not in it this meritorious film become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately,positive
